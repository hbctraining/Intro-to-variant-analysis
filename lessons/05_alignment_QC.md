# Alignment Quality Control

## Learning Objectives

- Verify alignment rates using `Picard`
- Merge `Picard` QC metrics with `FastQC` metrics using `MultiQC`

## Collecting Alignment Statistics

The next step of QC is where we need to evaluate the quality of the alignments. We will start by running the code required to compute metrics, then we will discuss the metrics and evaluate our results against the general expecations.

<p align="center">

</p>

We are going to use `Picard` once again in order to collect our alignment statistics. `Picard` has many packages for collecting different types of data, but the one we will be using is [`CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360040507751-CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics-Picard). This tool takes a **SAM/BAM file input** and **produces metrics** (in a tab delimited `.txt` file) detailing the quality of the read alignments. _Note that these quality filters are specific to Illumina data._  

Some examples of metrics reported include (but are not limited to):

* Total number of reads 
* Total number of PF (pass-filter) reads (reads that pass an internal qualty fitering on the Illumina sequencer)
* Total aligned PF reads (any PF read that has a sequence and position)
* High quality aligned PF reads (high quality == mapping quality >= 20)
* Reads aligned in pairs (vs. reads aligned with mate unaligned/not present)
* Read length (how to handle mixed lengths?)

Let's start creating an `sbatch` script for collecting metrics:

```
cd ~/variant_calling/scripts/
vim picard_metrics_normal.sbatch
```

First, we need to add our shebang line, description and `sbatch` directives to the script:

```
#!/bin/bash
# This sbatch script is for collecting alignment metrics using Picard 

# Assign sbatch directives
#SBATCH -p priority
#SBATCH -t 0-00:30:00
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH --mem 16G
#SBATCH -o picard_metrics_normal_%j.out
#SBATCH -e picard_metrics_normal_%j.err
```

Next, we need to load `Picard`:

```
# Load picard
module load picard/2.27.5
```

Next, let's assign our files to variables:

```
# Assign variables
INPUT_BAM=/n/scratch/users/${USER:0:1}/${USER}/variant_calling/alignments/syn3_normal_GRCh38.p7.coordinate_sorted.bam
REFERENCE=/n/groups/hbctraining/variant_calling/reference/GRCh38.p7.fa
OUTPUT_METRICS_FILE=/home/${USER}/variant_calling/reports/picard/syn3_normal/syn3_normal_GRCh38.p7.CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics.txt
```

Lastly, we can add the `Picard` command to gather the alignment metrics. We can break down this command into each of its components:

* `java -jar $PICARD/picard.jar CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics` Calls the `CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics` from within `Picard`
* `--INPUT $INPUT_BAM` This is the output from our previous `Picard` alignment processing steps
* `--REFERENCE_SEQUENCE $REFERENCE` This isn't a required parameter, but `Picard` can do a subset of mismatch-related metrics if this is provided
* `--OUTPUT $OUTPUT_METRICS_FILE` This is the file to write the output metrics to

```
# Run Picard CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics
java -jar $PICARD/picard.jar CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics \
  --INPUT $INPUT_BAM \
  --REFERENCE_SEQUENCE $REFERENCE \
  --OUTPUT $OUTPUT_METRICS_FILE
```

Now this script is all set to run! **Go ahead and save and quit.**

Now we will want to **create the tumor version of this submission script using `sed`** (as we have done previously):

```
sed 's/normal/tumor/g' picard_metrics_normal.sbatch > picard_metrics_tumor.sbatch
```

### Submitting scripts for Picard alignment processing

Before we submit our jobs, let's **check the status of our previous `Picard` alignment processing steps**:

```
squeue -u $USER
```

* **If your `Picard` alignment processing steps are not completed** yet, **WAIT** until they have finished before submitting these jobs to collect alignment metrics.

* **If your `Picard` alignment processing steps are completed**, then submit these jobs to collect alignment metrics:

```bash
sbatch picard_metrics_normal.sbatch
sbatch picard_metrics_tumor.sbatch
```

## Collecting Coverage Metrics

Coverage is the average level of alignment for any random locus in the genome. `Picard` also has a package called [`CollectWgsMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037269351-CollectWgsMetrics-Picard), which is also very nice for collecting data about coverage for alignments. However, **since our data set is whole exome sequencing rather than whole genome sequencing** and thus only compromises about 1-2% of the human genome, average **coverage across the whole genome is not a very useful metric**. However, if one did have whole genome data, then running `CollectWgsMetrics` would be useful. As such, in the dropdown box below we provide the code that you could use to collect this information.

## Factors Impacting Alignment

**EDIT** Once your script has finished running, we can take a look to see what kind of output was generated. In your __ directory, you should see `tab_file`. Let's use  `less` to view it:

**ADD SCREENSHOT OF OUTPUT TEXT FILE**

While we observe various metrics above, one of the **most important metrics for your alignment file is the alignment rate**. When aligning high-quality reads to a high quality reference genome, **one should expect to see alignment rates at 90% or better**. If alignment rates dipped below 80-85%, then there could be reason for further inspection. 

Alignment rates can vary based upon many factors, including:

- **Quality of reference assembly** - A high-quality assembly like GRCh38.p7 will provide an excellent reference genome for alignment. However, if you were studying a organism with a poorly assembled genome, parts of the reference genome could be missing from the assembly. Therefore, high-quality reads might not align because the corresponding reference sequence is missing.
- **Quality of libraries** - If the library generation was poor and there wasn't enough input DNA, then your sequencing could be filled with low-quality reads.
- **Quality of the reads** - If the reads are poor quality, then it can make alignment more uncertain. If your `FASTQC` report shows any anomalous signs, contact your sequencing center for support.
- **Contamination** - If your samples are contaminated, then it can also skew your alignment. For example, if your samples were heavily contaminated with some bacteria, then much of what you will sequence will be bacteria DNA and not your sample DNA. As a result, most of the sequence reads will not align to your target sequence. If you suspect contamination might be the source of a poor alignment, you could consider running [Kraken](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/) to evaluate the levels of contamination in your samples.
- **Evolutionary distance between the sampled organism and reference genome** If a reference genome doesn't exist for your species of interest, you are able to align reads to a closely-related organism. However, it does come at the cost of lowering the alignment rate.
- **Aligner and alignment parameters** Different aligners work differently and are specialized for different types of data. Additionally, many aligners have a variety of parameters that are able to be adjusted. As a result, different aligners or different parameters for the same aligner will give different alignment rates, but they usually should be within the same approximate alignment rate. Generally speaking, the default parameters for most alignment tools are usually fine and they shouldn't need to be manually adjusted/optimized unless there is a specific reason to do so.

## Aggregating QC metrics using MultiQC

The goal of this section is to show you how to **combine numerical stats from multiple QC runs into a single HTML report**. To do this aggregation, we will introduce you to [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) - a general use tool, perfect for summarizing the output from numerous bioinformatics tools. Rather than having to sift through multiple reports from individual samples and different tools, we can use MultiQC to evaluate quality metrics conveniently within a single file!

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/multiqc_screenshot.png" width="800">
</p>

One nice feature of `MultiQC` is that it accepts many different file formats. It figures out which format was submitted and tailors the report to that type of analysis. For this workflow we will combine the following QC stats:

* FastQC
* Alignment QC from Picard

Collating our `MultiQC` results would be relatively quick to just run from the command-line, but it's best practice to write our steps to scripts so that we always have a record of what we did and how we created our reports. We will start by making sure we are in our scripts directory and writing a `sbatch` script in `vim` for submission:

```
cd ~/variant_calling/scripts/
vim multiqc_alignment_metrics_normal_tumor.sbatch
```

First, we will add our sheband line, description and `sbatch` directives:

```
#!/bin/bash
# This sbatch script is for collating alignment metrics from FastQC and Picard using MultiQC

# Assign sbatch directives
#SBATCH -p priority
#SBATCH -t 0-00:10:00
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH --mem 1G
#SBATCH -o multiqc_alignment_metrics_%j.out
#SBATCH -e multiqc_alignment_metrics_%j.err
```

Next, we will load our modules:

```
# Load modules
module load gcc/9.2.0
module load multiqc/1.21
```
> NOTE: `MultiQC` version 1.12 requires `gcc/9.2.0` on the O2 cluster.

Next, we will assign our variables:

```
# Assign variables
REPORTS_DIRECTORY=/home/${USER}/variant_calling/reports/
NORMAL_SAMPLE_NAME=syn3_normal
TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME=syn3_tumor
REFERENCE=GRCh38.p7
NORMAL_PICARD_METRICS=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}picard/${NORMAL_SAMPLE_NAME}/${NORMAL_SAMPLE_NAME}_${REFERENCE}.CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics.txt
TUMOR_PICARD_METRICS=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}picard/${TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME}/${TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME}_${REFERENCE}.CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics.txt
NORMAL_FASTQC_1=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}fastqc/${NORMAL_SAMPLE_NAME}_1_fastqc.zip
NORMAL_FASTQC_2=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}fastqc/${NORMAL_SAMPLE_NAME}_2_fastqc.zip
TUMOR_FASTQC_1=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}fastqc/${TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME}_1_fastqc.zip
TUMOR_FASTQC_2=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}fastqc/${TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME}_2_fastqc.zip
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=${REPORTS_DIRECTORY}/multiqc/
```

We also need to add the output directory:

```
# Create directory for output
mkdir -p $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

Then, we will add **the command to run `MultiQC`**:

```
# Run MultiQC
multiqc \
  $NORMAL_PICARD_METRICS \
  $TUMOR_PICARD_METRICS \
  $NORMAL_FASTQC_1 \
  $NORMAL_FASTQC_2 \
  $TUMOR_FASTQC_1 \
  $TUMOR_FASTQC_2 \
  --outdir $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

### Submitting scripts for MultiQC
Like the previous step, we will need to check to ensure that the previous `Picard` step for collecting metrics for each sample is done before we can submit this script. To do this, we will check out `squeue`:

```
squeue -u $USER
```

* **If your `Picard` collect alignment metric steps are not completed** yet, **WAIT** until they have finished before submitting these jobs to `MultiQC`.
* **If your `Picard` collect alignment metric steps are completed and the only job you have running is your interactive job**, then submit this `MultiQC` job to collate the alignment metrics:

```
sbatch multiqc_alignment_metrics_normal_tumor.sbatch
```

This job should finish fairly quickly and then we can proceed to copying it over to our local computers so we can evaluate the alignment QC of our samples.
