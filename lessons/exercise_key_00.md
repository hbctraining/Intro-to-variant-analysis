1. If we assume there are no sequencing errors, are you more inclined to speculate that Locus 1 is a germline or somatic variant? Why?
- *Locus 1 is more likely to be a somatic variant because a germline variant would either manifest as a roughly 50:50 ratio of reference ("A") to alternate ("T") alleles, or all alternate alleles. However, it can be difficult to draw conclusions from such low sequencing depth.*

2. Given the existence of sequencing errors, how confident are you that Locus 1 represents a heterozygous locus in the germline?
- *Not very confident: In general for most heterozygous germline mutations we would expect roughly equal reference and alternate alleles, or all alternate alleles, from our sequencing, and the ratio we see much more lopsided; however with so few reads a sequencing error isn't out of the question*

3. Given the existence of sequencing errors, how confident are you that Locus 1 represents a polymorphic locus in a somatic tissue?
- *Still not very confident as we only have 2 reads of support, however it is more in-line with expectations for a somatic polymorphism rather than a germline variant, because somatic polymorphism don't need to have a 50:50 or 100:0, they can be any fraction*

4. How confident are you that Locus 2 is homozygous?
- *While the evidence is suggestive, we are not particularly confident with such a low sequencing depth*

5. What additional information might you want in order to better assess these loci?
- *More sequencing depth would allow us to better assess these loci and have more confidence in any conclusions we might draw*
