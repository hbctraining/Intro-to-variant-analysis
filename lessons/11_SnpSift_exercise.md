In this exercise we will use the VCF file that we have generated  in order to practice parsing our apart our VCF. The VCF file is also availible for download [here](https://hbctraining.github.io/variant_analysis/data/mutect2_syn3_normal_syn3_tumor_GRCh38.p7-pass-filt-LCR.pedigree_header.snpeff.dbSNP.vcf).

# Exercises

**1)** Extract all of the stop codon losses

**2)** Extract all of the variants on Chromosome 2 between 8Mb and 10.2Mb.

**3)** Extract all of the variants that alter a splice site on Chromosome 11.

**4)** Extract all of the high impact mutations on Chromosome 12 or moderate impact mutations on Chromosome 3.
